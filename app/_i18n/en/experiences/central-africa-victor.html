<p>African experience in all his expression…visiting  the southern part of the continent. A 20 days adventure trip with my family.</p>

<p>From  the Victoria falls to the famous natural reserves. Traveling in our truck, sleeping in caves, crossing deserts that dies on the ocean, surfing sand dunes and bodyboarding the Zambeze river… A true Adventure.</p>
